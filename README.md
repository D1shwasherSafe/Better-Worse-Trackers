Hi, this is a project I started to create a chassis for custom SlimeVR trackers. I noticed that generic 55x30x10mm lipo batteries are officially listed on the SlimeVR docs, but there arent many chassis(that I could find) built to fit these batteries, since most utilize smaller Aliexpress batteries which for me had a few shipping and supply issues. So here's a chassis to fit those batteries.

Any questions, concerns or requests? Shoot me a DM on twitter!
