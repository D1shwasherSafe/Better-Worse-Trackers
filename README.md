Hi, this is a project I started to create a chassis for custom SlimeVR trackers. I noticed that while generic 55x30x10mm lipo batteries are officially listed on the SlimeVR docs, there are almost no chassis(that I could find) built to fit these batteries, as most utilize smaller Aliexpress batteries. Those batteries, atleast for me had a few shipping and supply issues, whereas these batteries are relatively abundant where I am(US NE).

Any questions, concerns or recommendations? Shoot me a DM on twitter!
